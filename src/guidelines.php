        <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
        <div class="important-message">These are our Community Guidelines. Posting a project, comment, or forum post that does not follow these guidelines may result in account action. Please note that this is not legal advice, but our <a href="javascript:void(0)">announcements forum</a> may contain more rules.</div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Respectful Communication</h3>
            <p>Be kind and considerate to others. Treat everyone with respect, regardless of their background, experience, or skill level. Avoid personal attacks, insults, and offensive language.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Constructive Feedback</h3>
            <p>Share your projects and ideas in a positive and helpful way. If you see something that could be improved, offer constructive feedback that focuses on the project itself, not the person who created it. Be specific with your suggestions and offer solutions rather than just pointing out flaws.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Safety and Privacy</h3>
            <p>Respect the safety and privacy of yourself and others. Do not share personal information (real name, address, phone number, email address, etc.), and be cautious about interacting with people you don't know online. If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, report it to the moderators.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Meaningless Projects</h3>
            <p>Uploading default or blank projects will result in project removal. Repeated offenses may result in limitations on your ability to upload projects. However, projects that include meaningful content (such as a custom block pack, an extension, a font, or art) are ok.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>UltiBlocks Compatibility</h3>
            <p>Projects uploaded to the UltiBlocks website must actually work on UltiBlocks. Uploading projects that rely on blocks or features from other Scratch modifications (mods) is not permitted. This is because all projects should be able to work when opened in UltiBlocks, and uploading content incompatible with UltiBlocks defeats the purpose of uploading projects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Original Work & Attribution</h3>
            <p>Only share content that you have the right to share. Do not plagiarize or infringe on copyrights. Give credit to the original creators when using their work (e.g., music, sounds, images, or code). If you are using content under a Creative Commons license, ensure you follow the terms of that license.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Inappropriate Material</h3>
            <p>Do not share content that is sexually suggestive, including but not limited to depictions of nudity, sexual acts, or exploitation. Even a single instance of such content is a severe violation and will result in immediate and permanent account termination.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>Violence and Harmful Behavior</h3>
            <p>Do not create projects that are excessively violent or promote harmful behavior (e.g., self-harm, drug use). This includes glorifying violence, promoting dangerous activities, or encouraging self-destructive behavior.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>No Spam</h3>
            <p>Avoid spamming or flooding the community with irrelevant or repetitive projects. This includes uploading multiple versions of the same project with minor changes or creating projects solely for advertising purposes.</p>
